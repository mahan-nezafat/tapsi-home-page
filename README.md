# tapsi-home-page
tapsi.ir responsive home page with HTML, Sass, CSS, Js

# description 
this project was created with HTML, Css, Sass, Javascript. in this project I tried to impelent the original website design with Sass only instead of
[snappfood-landing-page](https://github.com/mahan-nezafat/snappfood-landing-page) that I used Sass and Bootstrap. it was a challenge of it's own
and beside that I made it fully responive and the project has the custom slider of the original website that change every few seconds will change with
click on items and show each segment of information in the place of the previous slide.
